# HomeMatic_EXE
Hi there! This repository consists of a C# project. Its purpose is to communicate with a [HomeMatic device](https://www.eq-3.com/products/homematic/control-units-and-gateways/homematic-central-control-unit-ccu2.html) which is able to control a bunch of actuators via radio waves. HomeMatic_EXE is an executable API which communicates over Ethernet sockets with the previously stated HomeMatic device.

This API is an executable since it is much more convenient when writing and testing code. Nevertheless, I created a class library for a better usage of the final version. If you like to have a look at it, feel free to visit [HomeMatic_DLL](https://github.com/cleanCoder1999/HomeMatic_DLL)
