# HomeMatic_EXE
Hi there! This repository consists of a C# project. Its purpose is to communicate with a HomeMatic device which is able to control a bunch of actuators via radio waves. HomeMatic_EXE is an executable API which communicates over Ethernet socket with the previously stated HomeMatic device.

This API is an executable since it is much more convenient when writing and testing code. Nevertheless, I created a class library for more convenient usage of the final version. If you like to have a look at it, feel free to click the following link: https://github.com/cleanCoder1999/HomeMatic_DLL
